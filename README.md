# Timer App Assignment

Welcome to the Timer App Assignment! This project is designed to evaluate your skills in React development, focusing on **UI implementation**, **code quality**, **state management**, and **best practices**. The project uses **React**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vitest** for testing.

---

## **Objective**
Your task is to improve and enhance an existing Timer App based on the following requirements. The app currently has a partially implemented timer system, and your goal is to address the listed issues and extend its functionality.

---

## **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend Framework**: React (with Vite for fast development)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest (for unit and component testing)

---

## **Steps to Complete**

1. **Fork or Clone the Repository**
   - Fork or clone the repository to your local machine.
   - Set up the project using the provided instructions.

2. **Complete the Following Tasks:**

   1. **Match the UI:**
      - Ensure the app's UI matches the given **screenshots**.

   2. **Simultaneous Timers:**
      - Update the app to allow multiple timers to run simultaneously (currently, only one timer runs at a time).

   3. **Snack Bar Behavior:**
      - When a timer is completed:
        - A snack bar notification should display.
        - The notification sound should keep playing until the snack bar is dismissed.

   4. **Fix Snack Bar Console Error:**
      - Resolve the **console error** that occurs when the snack bar's **dismiss button** is clicked.

   5. **Extract Common Components:**
      - Extract the buttons in the **Add/Edit Timer Modal** as a **separate reusable component**.
      - Replace all instances of similar buttons in the app with this component.

   6. **Consolidate Modal Code:**
      - Refactor the code to use a **single modal component** for both adding and editing timers, eliminating duplication.

   7. **Validation Snack Bars:**
      - Currently, the **Submit button** is disabled when the form is invalid.
      - Show an **error snack bar** or notification when the form is submitted with invalid data.

   8. **Responsive Snack Bar Placement:**
      - For **desktop devices**: Display snack bars in the **top-right corner**.
      - For **mobile devices**: Display snack bars at the **bottom of the screen**.

   9. **Write Tests:**
      - Add **unit tests** for the `validation.ts` file to ensure all validation rules work as expected.
      - Write **component tests** for reusable components like `TimerItem` and `ModalButtons`.

   10. **Timer Persistence:**
       - Use **localStorage** to persist timers across page refreshes.
